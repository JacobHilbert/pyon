# Default benchmark

A full-featured comparison is not possible, because JSON and CSON don't accept complex numbers or special-types keys.

So this is a comparison of load time for a file with all the features that JSON, CSON, PyON and YAML can represent.

Results (on my machine) are in the `results.pyon` file.
